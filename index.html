    <p>I love Harry Potter so much that I have at least <strong> twenty </strong>
      items of that fandom. You may say I am <em>crazy</em> but that's just me!</p>
    <p>What can I say? I <strong><em> love </strong></em> it! </p>

    <p>What is Harry Potter about?</p>
    <div>
    <p>Harry Potter is about a boy whose parents died and discovered he had magical abilities.
      He went on adventures with his two best friends Ron and Hermione. They learnt about magic
      and fought against the dark lord when eventually they defeated him. More stories await the
      magical world like Fantastic Beasts and the short books found in the Harry Potter universe.</p>
